## Best Practices

### Avatar Selection

<Tip>
  **Test with users**: Get feedback from your target audience before committing
  to an avatar.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Consider context**: The same avatar may work for some use cases but not
  others within your organization.
</Tip>

### Conversation Design

<Tip>
  **Account for visual cues**: Users expect facial expressions to match the tone
  of speech.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Pace appropriately**: Video interactions benefit from slightly slower pacing
  to allow visual processing.
</Tip>

### Technical Considerations

<Note>
  Video avatars require more bandwidth than voice-only interactions. Ensure your
  users have adequate internet connectivity.
</Note>

---

## Performance & Quality

### Optimizing Video Quality

For the best experience:

- Recommend users have stable internet connections
- Provide fallback to voice-only mode for poor connections
- Use adaptive quality settings when available

### Latency Considerations

Video synthesis adds minimal latency to conversations:

- Avatar response begins as voice synthesis starts
- Lip sync is computed in real-time
- Total added delay is typically imperceptible

---

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Avatar not displaying">
    - Check that video is enabled in agent settings - Verify browser supports
    video playback - Ensure stable internet connection - Check for ad blockers
    or security software interference
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lip sync issues">
    - This may occur with poor network conditions - Try refreshing the session -
    Consider switching to a lower quality setting
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Video quality is poor">
    - Check internet connection speed - Close other bandwidth-intensive
    applications - Try a different browser - Consider time of day and server
    load
  </Accordion>
