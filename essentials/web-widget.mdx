  for a seamless experience.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Idle Prompts**: Configure engaging idle messages that encourage visitors to
  interact ("Need help? Just ask!").
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Ensure your privacy policy covers AI conversations and data collection from
  the widget.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title="Widget not appearing">
    - Verify the agent ID is correct - Check browser console for errors - Ensure
    the script is loaded after the widget element
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Microphone not working">
    - User must grant microphone permission - HTTPS is required for microphone
    access - Check if another app is using the microphone
