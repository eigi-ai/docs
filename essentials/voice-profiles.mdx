## Voice Cloning

Create a unique voice that's exclusively yours.

<Warning>
  Voice cloning requires proper consent and authorization. Only clone voices you
  have legal rights to use.
</Warning>

### How Voice Cloning Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Record Sample">
    Provide a clear audio sample (typically 30 seconds to 3 minutes) of the
    voice you want to clone
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Processing">
    Our system analyzes the voice characteristics—tone, pitch, cadence, and
    unique qualities
  </Step>
  <Step title="Voice Model Created">
    A custom voice model is generated that captures the essence of the original
    voice
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy to Agent">
    Assign the cloned voice to your agent for use in conversations
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices for Voice Samples

For optimal voice cloning results:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Recording Quality" icon="microphone">
    - Use a quiet environment with minimal background noise - Record in a studio
    or well-insulated room - Use a quality microphone (USB or XLR) - Maintain
    consistent distance from the microphone
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Guidelines" icon="file-audio">
    - Speak naturally and clearly - Include varied sentences (questions,
    statements, exclamations) - Cover different emotions and tones - Avoid
    reading monotonously—speak as you would in conversation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Technical Requirements" icon="settings">
    - Audio format: WAV or MP3 - Sample rate: 44.1kHz or higher - Bit depth:
    16-bit or higher - Length: 30 seconds minimum, 3+ minutes recommended
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Voice Customization

### Adjusting Voice Parameters

Fine-tune your agent's voice for the perfect delivery:

| Parameter      | Description                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**      | Control how fast or slow the agent speaks     |
| **Pitch**      | Adjust the voice pitch higher or lower        |
| **Stability**  | Control voice consistency vs. expressiveness  |
| **Similarity** | How closely to match the original voice model |

### Emotional Expression

Natural conversations involve emotional variation. Configure how your agent expresses:

- **Enthusiasm**: For exciting announcements or positive responses
- **Empathy**: For sensitive customer service situations
- **Confidence**: For authoritative information delivery
- **Warmth**: For friendly, approachable interactions

## Voice Testing

    Listen to sample phrases spoken by your configured voice
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Conversation">
    Have a test conversation with your agent
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gather Feedback">
    Have team members evaluate the voice quality and fit
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate">Adjust parameters based on feedback</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Consistency**: Use the same voice across all agents in a project for brand
  cohesion.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Speed Matters**: Slightly slower speeds often work better for complex
  information; faster for casual conversations.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Test with Real Content**: Use actual prompts and responses when evaluating
  voices, not generic test phrases.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Voice technology is continuously improving. Check back regularly for new
  voices and enhanced capabilities.
</Note>
