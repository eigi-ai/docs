## Platform Concepts

<Info>
  An overview of the key components that make up eigi.ai voice agents and how
  they work together to create intelligent, human-like conversations.
</Info>

### Voice Agent Architecture

Every eigi.ai voice agent follows a sophisticated pipeline designed for natural, real-time conversations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Input Medium">
    The input method determines how users interact with your agent: - **Voice**:
    Via phone call or embedded web widget (microphone input) - **Text**:
    Chat-based interaction through the widget - **Video**: Visual conversations
    with digital avatars
  </Step>

  <Step title="Speech Recognition">
    Converts spoken input into text for processing. Our platform uses advanced
    speech-to-text technology to accurately transcribe user speech in real-time,
    supporting multiple languages and accents.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Intelligence Layer">
    The brain of your agent. This layer: - Interprets user intent - Maintains
    conversation context - Generates relevant, dynamic responses - Triggers
    actions and tools when needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Voice Synthesis">
    Transforms the agent's text response into natural-sounding speech. Choose
    from multiple voice profiles, including custom cloned voices that match your
    brand identity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Output Delivery">
    Delivers responses back to the user through: - **Voice**: Real-time audio
    playback - **Chat**: Text messages in the widget - **Video**: Synchronized
    with digital avatars
  </Step>
</Steps>
