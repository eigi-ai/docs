## Welcome to eigi.ai API

The eigi.ai API allows you to programmatically create, manage, and interact with AI voice agents. Build powerful integrations to automate calls, retrieve conversation data, and manage your voice agents at scale.

### Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://prod.eigi.ai/v1
```

## Authentication

eigi.ai uses **API Key authentication** for public endpoints. Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure and never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.

### API Key Header

All API requests must include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl https://prod.eigi.ai/v1/public/conversations \
  -H "X-API-Key: vk_your_api_key_here"
```

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your [eigi.ai Dashboard](https://eigi.ai)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create New API Key**
4. Copy and securely store your API key (it will only be shown once)

<Warning>
  **Keep your API keys secure!** Never commit them to version control or expose them in client-side code. Use environment variables or secure secret management systems.
</Warning>

### API Key Format

API keys follow this format:
```
vk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

All keys are prefixed with `vk_` to help identify them in code and logs.

## Authentication Flow

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "X-API-Key": "vk_your_api_key_here",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
}
```

### Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive one of these error responses:

| Status Code | Error | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `401` | Missing API Key | The `X-API-Key` header is not provided |
| `401` | Invalid API Key | The provided API key is not valid |
| `401` | Inactive API Key | The API key has been deactivated |
| `401` | Expired API Key | The API key has expired |
| `403` | Unauthorized Access | You don't have permission to access this resource |

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage and platform stability:

- **Free Tier**: 100 requests per minute
- **Pro Tier**: 500 requests per minute
- **Enterprise Tier**: Custom limits

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `Retry-After` header indicating when you can make requests again.
