## Overview

This endpoint creates conversations and initiates outbound calls via telephony provider (Plivo or Twilio) to specified phone numbers using your configured AI agent. You can initiate single calls or bulk calls by providing multiple phone numbers.

## Authentication

<ParamField header="X-API-Key" type="string" required>
  Your eigi.ai API key. Must be prefixed with `vk_`.
</ParamField>

## Request Body

<ParamField body="agent_id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the AI agent to use for the call. The agent must be owned by the API key holder and properly configured with LLM, TTS, and STT providers.

Example: `68ea2517dbb84c09bae1ba0a`

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="params" type="array" required>
  Array of call parameter objects. Each object represents one outbound call to
  initiate. Each item should have `mobile_number` (string, required) in E.164
  format and optional `metadata` object.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="telephony_provider" type="string" default="PLIVO">
  Telephony provider to use for the call. Options: `PLIVO` or `TWILIO`

Defaults to `PLIVO` if not specified.

</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  Status of the request: `success`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  Human-readable message describing the result: `Outbound calls initiated
  successfully`
</ResponseField>

<Note>
  The API initiates calls asynchronously. Use webhooks or poll the [Get
  Conversation](/api-reference/public/get-conversation) endpoint with the
  conversation ID to track call status and retrieve transcripts after
  completion.

## Phone Number Format

Phone numbers must be in **E.164 format**:

- Start with `+` followed by country code
- No spaces, dashes, or parentheses
- Example: `+919876543210` (India), `+14155551234` (US)

<Warning>
  **Invalid formats** will result in failed calls: - ❌ `9876543210` (missing
  country code) - ❌ `+91 98765 43210` (contains spaces) - ❌ `+91-9876543210`
  (contains dashes) - ✅ `+919876543210` (correct format)
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Use Metadata Effectively**: Include relevant customer information in the `metadata` field. Your agent can access this data during the conversation for personalization.

```json
"metadata": {
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "customer_id": "CUST-12345",
  "order_id": "ORD-67890",
  "appointment_date": "2025-12-15"
}
```

</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Batch Processing**: For bulk calls, process in batches of 50-100 numbers to
  manage rate limits and monitor results effectively.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Error Handling**: Always check individual `status` in the results array, as
  some calls may succeed while others fail.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Track Conversation IDs**: Store the returned `conversation_id` for each call
  to later retrieve transcripts and analysis using the [Get
  Conversation](/api-reference/public/get-conversation) endpoint.
</Tip>

## Webhooks for Call Events

Configure webhooks to receive real-time notifications about call events:

- `conversation.started` - Call initiated
- `conversation.answered` - Call answered by recipient
- `conversation.completed` - Call completed successfully
- `conversation.failed` - Call failed
- `conversation.disconnected` - Call disconnected

Learn more in the [Webhook Documentation](/api-reference/endpoint/webhook).

## Limitations

- **Rate Limits**: API key tier determines maximum calls per minute
- **Daily Quota**: Check your plan's daily outbound call limit
- **Agent Configuration**: Agent must have valid telephony settings (Plivo/Twilio credentials, phone number)
- **Phone Number Validation**: Invalid phone numbers will fail individually without blocking other calls

## Notes

- Each call creates a unique `conversation_id` for tracking
- Calls are initiated asynchronously; use webhooks or polling for status updates
- Failed calls don't count against your quota
- Metadata is optional but highly recommended for personalized conversations
- Call recording and transcription are automatic (if enabled in agent settings)
- Default telephony provider is Plivo; specify `TWILIO` if using Twilio
