## Analysis Schema

### Define What to Extract

Create a custom schema that tells the AI exactly what information to pull from conversations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Text Fields" icon="font">
    Extract text data like names, reasons, feedback
  </Card>
  <Card title="Number Fields" icon="hashtag">
    Capture numeric values like ratings, quantities, scores
  </Card>
  <Card title="Boolean Fields" icon="toggle-on">
    Yes/No determinations like "interested", "resolved"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Choice Fields" icon="list">
    Categorical values from predefined options
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Example Schema

| Field                | Type    | Description                   |
| -------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| `customer_sentiment` | Choice  | positive, neutral, negative   |
| `issue_category`     | Text    | Type of issue discussed       |
| `resolution_status`  | Boolean | Was the issue resolved?       |
| `satisfaction_score` | Number  | 1-10 rating if provided       |
| `follow_up_needed`   | Boolean | Does customer need follow-up? |
| `key_topics`         | Text    | Main topics discussed         |
| `action_items`       | Text    | Next steps identified         |

## Analysis Prompt

### Customizing Analysis

Write specific instructions for how calls should be analyzed:

```text
Analyze this customer service conversation and extract:

1. Customer Sentiment: Determine if the customer's overall sentiment
   was positive, neutral, or negative based on their tone and words.

2. Issue Category: Identify the main reason for the call
   (billing, technical, general inquiry, complaint, etc.)

3. Resolution: Did the agent successfully resolve the customer's issue?
   Answer true or false.

4. Satisfaction Score: If the customer expressed satisfaction or
   gave a rating, capture it on a 1-10 scale. Otherwise, estimate
   based on the conversation tone.

5. Follow-up Needed: Based on the conversation, does this customer
   need any follow-up action? Answer true or false.

6. Summary: Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of the call.
```

## Structured Data Extraction

### Automatic Data Capture

The AI extracts structured data from natural conversations:

**Example Conversation:**

```
Agent: "May I have your email address for the confirmation?"
Customer: "Sure, it's john.smith@email.com"
Agent: "And what date works best for you?"
Customer: "How about next Tuesday at 2pm?"
```

**Extracted Data:**

```json
{
  "email": "john.smith@email.com",
  "preferred_date": "Tuesday",
  "preferred_time": "2:00 PM"
}
```
