## Best Practices

### Prompt Structure

<Tip>
  **Use Clear Sections**: Organize prompts into Identity, Style, Guidelines,
  Tasks, and Error Handling sections.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Be Specific**: Vague instructions lead to inconsistent behavior. Be explicit
  about what you want.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Commit Often**: Save versions frequently with descriptive messages for easy
  tracking.
</Tip>

### Version Control

<Tip>
  **Meaningful Messages**: Write commit messages that explain WHY you made
  changes, not just what changed.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Test Before Major Changes**: Create a version, test thoroughly, then make
  significant edits.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Don't make untested changes to production agents during peak hours. Use the
  sandbox first.
</Warning>
