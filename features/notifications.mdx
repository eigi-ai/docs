## Notification Management

### Viewing History

Track all sent notifications:

- Filter by date, type, channel
- See delivery status
- View notification content
- Retry failed deliveries

### Rate Limiting

<Info>
  Notifications are rate-limited to prevent spam. High-volume events are
  automatically batched.
</Info>

| Channel     | Rate Limit             |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| **Email**   | 100/hour per recipient |
| **Webhook** | 1000/hour per endpoint |
| **Slack**   | 60/minute per channel  |
| **SMS**     | 10/hour per number     |

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Don't Over-Notify**: Configure filters to avoid alert fatigue. Focus on
  actionable events.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use Appropriate Channels**: Urgent issues → SMS/Slack. Detailed reports →
  Email. System integration → Webhooks.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Test Your Webhooks**: Verify your endpoints handle payloads correctly before
  going live.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Ensure notification recipients have appropriate access to the information
  being shared.
</Warning>
