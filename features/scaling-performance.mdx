| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Steady**          | Consistent capacity allocation |
| **Peak Hours**      | Scale up during busy times     |
| **Campaign Bursts** | Reserve capacity for campaigns |
| **Seasonal**        | Adjust for seasonal variations |

---

## Testing at Scale

### Load Testing

Before launching high-volume campaigns:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Baseline Test">Measure performance at current volume</Step>
  <Step title="Gradual Increase">Slowly increase load to find limits</Step>
  <Step title="Stress Test">Test beyond expected maximum</Step>
  <Step title="Failure Testing">Verify graceful degradation</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Best Practices

<Tip>**Plan for Peak**: Size your capacity for peak demand, not average.</Tip>

<Tip>**Configure Fallbacks**: Always have backup providers configured.</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Monitor Proactively**: Set up alerts before hitting capacity limits.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Test your scaling configuration before running large campaigns. Start small
  and scale up gradually.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Calls being queued unexpectedly">
    - Check current concurrency vs. limit - Review call duration (longer calls
    use capacity longer) - Consider upgrading your plan - Optimize agent prompts
    for efficiency
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High latency during peak times">
    - Verify you're not hitting capacity limits - Check provider status for
    degradation - Review if specific tools are causing delays - Consider
    geographic distribution
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Inconsistent call quality">
    - Check network connectivity - Verify provider health status - Review audio
    settings - Test with different providers
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
