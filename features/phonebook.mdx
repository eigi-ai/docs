  <Accordion title="Tags" icon="tags">
    Apply labels to contacts: - "Hot Lead" - "Follow-up Required" - "VIP
    Customer" - Custom tags you define
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Segments" icon="filter">
    Create dynamic groups based on criteria: - All contacts with specific tag -
    Contacts from certain date range - Contacts with specific custom field
    values
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Dynamic Variables

### Personalizing Conversations

Use contact data in your agent's prompts and conversations:

```text
[Task]
1. Greet the customer: "Hi {{name}}, this is your call from TechCorp."
2. Reference their company: "I'm reaching out about {{company}}'s account."
3. Mention their status: "As a {{custom_field_1}} member, you have access to..."
```

### Available Variables

Any contact field becomes a usable variable:

| Contact Field  | Variable             | Example Value      |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| name           | `{{name}}`           | "John Smith"       |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Import failing">
    - Check CSV format (UTF-8 encoding) - Verify phone numbers include country
    codes - Look for special characters that might cause issues
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Variables not working">
    - Ensure field names match exactly (case-sensitive) - Check that the contact
    has data in that field - Verify the variable syntax: `{{ field_name }}`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate contacts">
    - Use "Skip Duplicates" on import - Search and merge duplicates manually -
    Use phone number as unique identifier
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
